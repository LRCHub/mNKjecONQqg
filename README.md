```lrc
[02:11.01] I cried, for I didn't think it could be true
[02:15.22] That you and I might have always known one another
[02:19.24] And that we could not only evoke, but conjure a place of our own
[02:23.42] And everywhere, that has ever existed
[02:26.63] Is all on the surface of our dream
[02:29.51] Now please, hear what I hear
[03:12.57] Let me explain
[03:13.94] This ugliness, this cruelty, this repulsiveness
[03:19.57] It will all die out
[03:21.66] And now, I cry for all that is beautiful
[04:09.36] Let me explain
